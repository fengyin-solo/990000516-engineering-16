# Task Board

A lightweight Trello-like task board application built with Vue 3 and Express.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Vue 3 + Vite
- Vue Router
- Pinia (state management)
- Element Plus (UI components)
- vuedraggable (drag and drop)
- Axios (HTTP client)

### Backend
- Node.js + Express
- better-sqlite3 (SQLite database)
- jsonwebtoken (JWT authentication)
- bcryptjs (password hashing)
- cors

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run seed     # Seed database with demo data
npm run dev      # Start server on port 3002
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev      # Start dev server on port 5174
```

### Demo Account

- Username: `demo`
- Password: `demo123`

The seed script creates a demo user with a sample board "My Project" containing 3 columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) and 7 sample cards.

## Security Checks (Data Ownership)

The backend ships with a repeatable local check suite for data-ownership security:

```bash
cd backend
npm run check:security
```

It runs in stages and reports the exact stage on failure:

1. **Dependency check** — Node.js >= 18 and backend packages installed (otherwise it tells you to run `npm install`).
2. **Isolated server** — starts a throwaway API server on a random free port with a temporary SQLite database. Your dev database (`backend/data/taskboard.db`) is never touched.
3. **Fixtures** — creates two users, each with a board, columns, and cards.
4. **Auth boundary** — no login / empty token / wrong scheme / expired token / forged signature must all return `401`.
5. **Cross-account reads** — user B must not see user A's boards, columns, or cards (`404` / list isolation).
6. **Cross-account writes** — moving a card into another user's column, creating a column in or deleting another user's board/card must return `404` and leave the data untouched.
7. **Compatibility** — normal user operations (health, login, create board/card, move own card, delete own board) must keep working.
8. **Cleanup** — the temp server is stopped and the temp database deleted, so repeated runs leave no residual data.

Exit code is `0` when all checks pass, `1` otherwise (failures list the stage, expected vs. actual HTTP status).

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login (returns JWT)

### Boards
- `GET /api/boards` - List user's boards
- `POST /api/boards` - Create board
- `DELETE /api/boards/:id` - Delete board

### Columns
- `GET /api/boards/:boardId/columns` - Get columns for a board
- `POST /api/boards/:boardId/columns` - Add column
- `PUT /api/columns/:id` - Update column (rename/reorder)
- `DELETE /api/columns/:id` - Delete column

### Cards
- `GET /api/columns/:columnId/cards` - Get cards in column
- `POST /api/columns/:columnId/cards` - Add card
- `PUT /api/cards/:id` - Update card
- `DELETE /api/cards/:id` - Delete card
- `PUT /api/cards/:id/move` - Move card to another column

## Features

- User authentication with JWT
- Create and manage multiple boards
- Add, rename, and delete columns
- Create cards with title, description, priority (low/medium/high), and due date
- Drag and drop cards between columns
- Drag and drop to reorder columns
- Responsive design with Element Plus UI
